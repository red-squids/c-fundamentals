# Projects to be done

## Foundational C Programming Projects:

* Command-Line Calculator: 
    Create a command-line calculator application in C that can perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This will help you practice basic input/output and arithmetic operations.

* Simple File Reader/Writer: 
    Build a C program that reads data from one file and writes it to another file. This will introduce you to file handling in C.

* Basic Text Editor: 
    Develop a basic text editor that allows users to open, edit, and save text files. This project will require working with file I/O and user input.

* To-Do List Manager: 
    Create a command-line to-do list manager that allows users to add, remove, list, and mark tasks as completed. This project will involve data structures like arrays or linked lists.

Linux System Programming Preparation Projects:

* File Information Utility: 
    Write a C program that displays detailed information about a file, such as its permissions, size, owner, and modification time. This project will involve using system calls like stat and working with file metadata.

* Process Monitoring Tool: 
    Develop a tool that can list currently running processes on your Linux system, including their names and resource usage (CPU and memory). You can use system calls like opendir, readdir, and stat to explore the /proc directory.

* Simple Shell: 
    Create a basic shell (command-line interpreter) in C that can execute simple commands entered by the user. This project will introduce you to process creation and management using system calls like fork, exec, and wait.

* File Copy Utility: 
    Build a C program that can copy files and directories from one location to another. You'll need to use system calls like open, read, write, and mkdir to implement this utility.

* IPC (Interprocess Communication) Examples: 
    Explore IPC mechanisms in Linux by implementing projects that use techniques like pipes, sockets, and shared memory for communication between processes. For example, you could create a simple chat application using sockets.

* Signals and Signal Handling: 
    Write programs that demonstrate signal handling in Linux. For instance, create a program that sends and receives signals to handle events like Ctrl+C (SIGINT) or termination (SIGTERM).
